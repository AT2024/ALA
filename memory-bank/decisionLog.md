# Decision Log

## Technical Decisions

### Initial Project Structure (2025-06-05)
Initialized Unknown with a modular architecture using Node.js

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Project-wide

Rationale:
Established foundation for scalable and maintainable development




### Development Workflow (2025-06-05)
Established initial development workflow and practices

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Development process

Rationale:
Ensure consistent development process and code quality

Alternatives Considered:
- Ad-hoc development process
- Waterfall methodology



### Documentation Strategy (2025-06-05)
Implemented automated documentation with memory bank

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Project documentation

Rationale:
Maintain up-to-date project context and decision history

### Multi-Site Access Bug Investigation (2025-06-05)
User reports that when they have access to multiple sites (multiple CUSTNAME values), only the first site appears in the site selection dropdown instead of all accessible sites

**Status:** proposed
**Impact:** User experience and access control functionality

Rationale:
This is a critical functionality issue affecting users with multi-site access. Need to investigate the user authentication flow and site loading logic to identify where the filtering is occurring incorrectly.

Alternatives Considered:
- Investigate frontend site loading logic
- Check backend API responses
- Review user authentication and permission handling

### Multi-Site Access Bug Analysis Complete (2025-06-05)
Found that Priority service correctly fetches multiple sites for admin users, but there may be issues in frontend site processing or display logic

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** User interface and multi-site functionality

Rationale:
The backend correctly fetches unique sites from PHONEBOOK table for positionCode 99 users, but the frontend site selection logic needs investigation

Alternatives Considered:
- Fix frontend site processing
- Add debugging to identify exact failure point
- Enhance site selection UI

### Fix Multi-Site Access for Non-Admin Users - Implementation Approved (2025-06-05)
Implement fix to collect all CUSTNAME values for non-admin users instead of returning only the first one

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Critical user access functionality

Rationale:
User confirmed this is the exact issue - non-admin users with multiple sites only see first site. Need to modify Priority service to fetch ALL sites for non-admin users by querying all PHONEBOOK records for that user.

Alternatives Considered:
- Query all PHONEBOOK records for user
- Collect unique CUSTNAME values
- Return complete site list

### Multi-Site Access Fix Implemented Successfully (2025-06-05)
Successfully fixed the multi-site access issue by creating getAllSitesForUser helper function, enhancing both exact match and case-insensitive search paths, adding comprehensive logging, and creating debug endpoint for testing

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Critical functionality restored for non-admin users with multiple sites

Rationale:
Implemented comprehensive fix that queries ALL PHONEBOOK records for a user to collect all unique CUSTNAME values instead of returning only the first site

Alternatives Considered:
- Created getAllSitesForUser helper function
- Enhanced both search paths (exact and case-insensitive)
- Added comprehensive logging and error handling
- Added debug endpoint for testing
- Added test user with multiple sites

### Fixed Priority Connection Issues from Multi-Site Implementation (2025-06-05)
Fixed Priority connection errors by adding proper error handling to getAllSitesForUser helper function, implementing fallback to original logic when new functionality fails, and enhancing debug capabilities

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Restored Priority system connectivity while maintaining multi-site functionality

Rationale:
Added comprehensive error handling, fallback logic, and connection testing to prevent the multi-site implementation from breaking Priority connectivity

Alternatives Considered:
- Added try-catch blocks around all new API calls
- Implemented fallback to original single-site logic
- Enhanced debug endpoint with connection testing
- Added validation for email and phone parameters

### Multi-Site Access and Docker Backend Issues Completely Resolved (2025-06-05)
Complete resolution achieved by implementing multi-site access logic for non-admin users AND fixing PostgreSQL version incompatibility in Docker containers

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Full system functionality restored with multi-site access working for non-admin users

Rationale:
Successfully fixed both the original multi-site access issue and the underlying Docker PostgreSQL version incompatibility that was preventing backend connectivity

Alternatives Considered:
- Fixed getUserSiteAccess for multi-site non-admin users
- Diagnosed and resolved PostgreSQL 15â†’16.6 incompatibility
- Rebuilt containers with fresh compatible database
- Verified all services healthy and functioning
