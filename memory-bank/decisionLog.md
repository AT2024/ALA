### Fix App Startup Issues - Dependencies and Backend Connectivity (2025-06-05)
Resolve @headlessui/react import error and backend API connectivity issues that occurred after Phase 2 implementation

**Status:** proposed
**Impact:** Critical - app cannot start or function without fixing these core infrastructure issues

Rationale:
The app was working before Phase 2 but now fails to start due to: 1) Docker containers not running, 2) Dependencies not accessible in container environment, 3) Backend service not available

Alternatives Considered:
- Run app locally without Docker
- Rebuild Docker containers from scratch
- Restart existing containers and check volume mounts

### Fix App Startup Issues - Dependencies and Backend Connectivity (2025-06-05)
Execute 4-phase plan: 1) Infrastructure restart with container rebuild, 2) Dependency verification, 3) Backend connectivity testing, 4) Application testing and validation

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Critical - app cannot start or function without fixing these core infrastructure issues

Rationale:
User confirmed the analysis and solution plan. The app was working before Phase 2 but now fails due to Docker containers not running and backend service unavailable

Alternatives Considered:
- Run app locally without Docker
- Rebuild Docker containers from scratch
- Restart existing containers and check volume mounts

### Fix App Startup Issues - Dependencies and Backend Connectivity (2025-06-05)
COMPLETED: All app startup issues resolved. Backend API healthy, frontend accessible at localhost:3000, dependencies properly installed and importing correctly

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Critical - app can now start and function correctly

Rationale:
Successfully resolved all startup issues: 1) Rebuilt Docker containers to ensure fresh environment, 2) Fixed TypeScript property mismatch errors (priorityOrderId -> priorityId), 3) Fixed undefined data access patterns, 4) Fixed Date/string type mismatches

Alternatives Considered:
- Run app locally without Docker
- Rebuild Docker containers from scratch
- Restart existing containers and check volume mounts
