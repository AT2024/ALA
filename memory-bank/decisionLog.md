# Decision Log

## Technical Decisions

### Initial Project Structure (2025-05-19)
Initialized Unknown with a modular architecture using Node.js

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Project-wide

Rationale:
Established foundation for scalable and maintainable development




### Development Workflow (2025-05-19)
Established initial development workflow and practices

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Development process

Rationale:
Ensure consistent development process and code quality

Alternatives Considered:
- Ad-hoc development process
- Waterfall methodology



### Documentation Strategy (2025-05-19)
Implemented automated documentation with memory bank

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Project documentation

Rationale:
Maintain up-to-date project context and decision history

### Code Cleanup - Remove Unused and Duplicate Files (2025-05-19)
Identified and removing multiple unused and duplicate files that bloat the repository and create confusion

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Repository size reduction, improved build performance, cleaner codebase

Rationale:
The project contains duplicate files (seedUser.js/ts), an entire embedded repository (memory-bank/memory-bank), and temporary files that should not be in version control. Removing these will reduce repository size by ~50MB and improve maintainability.

Alternatives Considered:
- Keep all files as-is
- Archive files instead of deleting
- Create separate branches for cleanup

### Created Unified Debug Tool (2025-05-19)
Replaced multiple debug scripts (ala-dev.bat, debug.sh, scripts/debug.js) with a single unified Node.js tool that works cross-platform

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Simplified development workflow, reduced maintenance burden, improved developer experience

Rationale:
Having multiple debug tools with overlapping functionality creates confusion and maintenance overhead. A single tool provides consistent experience across Windows, Linux, and macOS while combining all debug capabilities.

Alternatives Considered:
- Keep separate tools for each platform
- Use Docker-only debugging
- Create shell-script-only solution

### Code Cleanup and Optimization Strategy (2025-05-29)
Completed comprehensive analysis of ALA codebase to identify unused, duplicate, and inefficient files

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Significant improvement in maintainability, deployment speed, and resource usage

Rationale:
The codebase has accumulated redundant files, duplicate configurations, and development-only components that increase complexity and deployment size. Cleaning up these files will improve maintainability and performance.

Alternatives Considered:
- Keep all files for backward compatibility
- Gradual cleanup over time
- Complete rewrite (rejected - too risky)

Related Decisions:
- Docker optimization strategy
- Development vs Production file separation
