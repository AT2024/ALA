## Details

### Memory Bank Restructuring
- **Date:** 2025-05-18T16:45:00Z
- **Author:** AlphaTau Development Team
- **Category:** Documentation
- **Status:** Approved

**Rationale:** The memory bank files were becoming too long and contained repetitive information. Standardizing the format improves maintainability and ensures consistent documentation of project decisions and progress.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Continue with existing formats
- Use a database instead of Markdown files

**Impact:** Improved documentation clarity and maintenance process.

### Priority API Backend Proxy
- **Date:** 2025-05-15T14:20:00Z
- **Author:** AlphaTau Development Team
- **Category:** Architecture
- **Status:** Approved

**Rationale:** Direct frontend-to-Priority API calls were causing multiple issues including CORS problems, security concerns with exposing credentials, and general integration difficulties. By moving all Priority API calls through our backend, we provide a secure, consistent interface that handles authentication, error handling, and data formatting.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Continue with direct frontend-to-Priority API calls with CORS workarounds
- Create a separate microservice for Priority integration
- Use mock data instead of real Priority integration

**Impact:** This change affects the authentication flow, treatment retrieval, and all other Priority-related functionality across the application. The primary benefits include improved security, better error handling, and a more consistent user experience.

### Verification Code Authentication
- **Date:** 2025-05-15T15:45:00Z
- **Author:** AlphaTau Development Team
- **Category:** Security
- **Status:** Approved

**Rationale:** Implementing a verification code system provides a secure authentication method while avoiding password storage. This is particularly important for medical applications where security is critical.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Traditional username/password authentication
- OAuth with external providers
- Client certificates

**Impact:** Enhanced security and user-friendly authentication process.

### Initial Project Structure
- **Date:** 2025-05-18T10:00:00Z  
- **Author:** AlphaTau Development Team
- **Category:** Architecture
- **Status:** Approved

**Rationale:** Established foundation for scalable and maintainable development by adopting a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

**Impact:** Project-wide architecture and organization.

---

### Development Workflow
- **Date:** 2025-05-18T10:15:00Z
- **Author:** AlphaTau Development Team
- **Category:** Process
- **Status:** Approved

**Rationale:** Ensure consistent development process and code quality through standardized workflows.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Ad-hoc development process
- Waterfall methodology

**Impact:** Development process and team collaboration.

---

### Documentation Strategy
- **Date:** 2025-05-18T10:30:00Z
- **Author:** AlphaTau Development Team
- **Category:** Documentation
- **Status:** Approved

**Rationale:** Maintain up-to-date project context and decision history through automated documentation mechanisms.

**Impact:** Project documentation and knowledge management.
