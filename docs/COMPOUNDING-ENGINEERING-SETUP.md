# Compounding Engineering System - Setup Complete ✅

**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Status**: Fully Operational
**Inspired by**: [Every Marketplace Compounding Engineering Philosophy](https://github.com/EveryInc/every-marketplace)

---

## 🎉 What's New

Your ALA Medical Application now has a complete **compounding engineering system** - a self-improving development workflow where each task makes future work easier, not harder.

### The Core Philosophy

> "Each unit of engineering work makes subsequent units of work easier—not harder."

This is achieved through:
1. **Three-Lane Workflow**: Planning → Implementation → Review
2. **Learning Loops**: Every bug/feature teaches the system
3. **Knowledge Capture**: Patterns, pitfalls, and decisions documented
4. **Quality Gates**: mcp-as-a-judge validates before moving forward
5. **Agent Specialization**: 10 specialized agents handle different concerns

### 2. Three New Reviewer Agents

Located in [.claude/agents/](.claude/agents/):

**[ala-code-reviewer.md](.claude/agents/ala-code-reviewer.md)**
- Reviews code quality and TypeScript best practices
- Checks adherence to established patterns
- Validates documentation standards
- **Role**: General code quality gatekeeper

**[priority-api-reviewer.md](.claude/agents/priority-api-reviewer.md)**
- Reviews Priority ERP integration code
- Validates OData query syntax
- Checks applicator validation completeness
- Ensures test/prod data isolation
- **Role**: Priority integration specialist

**[medical-safety-reviewer.md](.claude/agents/medical-safety-reviewer.md)**
- Reviews patient safety requirements
- Validates data integrity and audit trails
- Checks transaction boundaries
- Ensures PHI protection
- **Role**: Medical safety gatekeeper (CRITICAL!)

### 3. Enhanced CLAUDE.md

Your [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) now includes:

**New Sections**:
- **Three-Lane Workflow Model** - How to orchestrate agents and tools
- **Learning Loops** - How to capture knowledge after bugs/features
- **Decision Log** - Why we made key architectural choices
- **Known Pitfalls & Solutions** - Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- **Testing Patterns** - What test strategies work well
- **Quality Gates** - The 6-gate approval process

**Enhanced Sections**:
- **Specialized Agent Usage** - Now distinguishes implementation vs reviewer agents
- Clear workflow guidance for when to use which tool/agent

## 🚀 How to Use It

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

Read: [docs/workflows/compounding/QUICK-START.md](docs/workflows/compounding/QUICK-START.md)

### Complete Guide

Read: [docs/workflows/compounding/COMPOUNDING-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md](docs/workflows/compounding/COMPOUNDING-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md)

### Example Workflow

**Adding a feature with the full system**:

```
Step 1: Planning
You: "Add treatment notes feature"
Claude uses: set_coding_task → judge_coding_plan

Step 2: Implementation (Parallel)
Claude: "Using database-specialist and frontend-ui in parallel"
[Both agents work simultaneously]

Step 3: Review
Claude runs: ala-code-reviewer → medical-safety-reviewer → judge_code_change

Step 4: Testing
Claude uses: testing-specialist → judge_testing_implementation

Step 5: Completion & Learning
Claude uses: judge_coding_task_completion
Then documents: patterns, learnings, ADR if needed

Result: Feature complete + System learned how to do it better next time!
```

## 🔧 The 10-Agent System

### Implementation Agents (Build Features)

Located in [.claude/agents/](.claude/agents/):

1. **testing-specialist** - Test creation, debugging, coverage
2. **priority-integration** - Priority API, OData, applicator validation
3. **frontend-ui** - React components, TypeScript, Tailwind
4. **deployment-azure** - Azure VM, Docker, production
5. **database-specialist** - PostgreSQL, migrations, Sequelize
6. **performance-optimization** - Bottlenecks, optimization
7. **security-audit** - Auth, JWT, vulnerabilities

### Reviewer Agents (Ensure Quality) ⭐ NEW!

1. **ala-code-reviewer** - Code quality & patterns
2. **priority-api-reviewer** - Priority integration correctness
3. **medical-safety-reviewer** - Patient safety & data integrity

### How They Work Together

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐

## 📊 MCP-as-a-Judge Tools

Your system now uses these quality gates:

### Planning Gate
- **`set_coding_task`** - Start any substantial change (creates task_id)
- **`raise_missing_requirements`** - Clarify ambiguous requirements
- **`raise_obstacle`** - Involve user in critical decisions
- **`judge_coding_plan`** - Validate plan before implementation

### Implementation Gate
- **`judge_code_change`** - Review implementation against plan
- Requires: Git diff of all changes
- Validates: Quality, safety, pattern compliance

### Testing Gate
- **`judge_testing_implementation`** - Validate test quality
- Requires: Test files + test execution output
- Validates: Coverage, test quality, execution results

### Completion Gate
- **`judge_coding_task_completion`** - Final validation
- Checks: All gates passed, requirements met
- Approves: Ready for deployment

### Recovery Tool
- **`get_current_coding_task`** - Recover task_id if lost

## 🔄 Learning Loops - The Secret Sauce

### After Every Bug Fix

1. Create `docs/learnings/bugs/YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`
2. Extract pattern to `docs/patterns/` if reusable
3. Update relevant reviewer agent
4. Add to CLAUDE.md if broadly applicable
5. Create regression test

**Result**: Similar bugs prevented automatically in future!

### After Production Errors

1. Create `docs/learnings/errors/YYYY-MM-DD-error-description.md`
2. Implement monitoring improvements
3. Create reproduction test
4. Update medical-safety-reviewer if safety-related
5. Document prevention

**Result**: Production errors teach the system!

### After Feature Completion

1. Document patterns in `docs/patterns/[domain]/pattern-name.md`
2. Note what worked well
3. Update CLAUDE.md if should be default
4. Update reviewer checklists if should be enforced

**Result**: Successful approaches reused automatically!

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Parallel is Faster**:
```
"Use database-specialist and frontend-ui agents in parallel"
```

**Auto-Selection Works Well**:
```
"Fix Priority API timeout"  → auto-triggers priority-integration
"React component slow"      → auto-triggers frontend-ui
"Add database field"        → auto-triggers database-specialist
```

**Review Before Committing**:
```
"Review this code with all applicable reviewers"
```

**Full Workflow for Big Changes**:
```
"Add nurse tracking feature using the full workflow"
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Triggering?
- Use explicit keywords ("Priority API", "React component", "database")
- Or explicitly request: "Use priority-integration agent"

### Task ID Lost?
- Use `get_current_coding_task` to recover it
- Always save task_id for reference

### Reviewer Agent Too Strict?
- They're supposed to be! That's good for quality
- But you can edit agents in [.claude/agents/](.claude/agents/) if needed

### Don't Know Which Workflow to Use?
- **Substantial changes**: Full workflow
- **Bug fixes**: set_coding_task + implement + review + document
- **Trivial changes**: Just do it, no workflow
