```

## üöÄ How to Use Sub-Agents

### Automatic Invocation (Recommended)
Just ask Claude Code naturally about your task. The appropriate specialist will be automatically selected:

```bash
"The Priority API is timing out when fetching patient data"
‚Üí Automatically invokes priority-integration agent

"Need to add a new table for tracking user sessions"
‚Üí Automatically invokes database-specialist agent

"The treatment progress component is rendering slowly"
‚Üí Automatically invokes frontend-ui agent
```

### Manual Invocation
You can also explicitly request a specific agent:

```bash
"Use the priority-integration agent to debug the OData query issues"
"Have the deployment-azure agent check the production containers"
"Ask the security-audit agent to review the authentication flow"
```

### Parallel Agent Execution
Ask Claude Code to use multiple agents simultaneously:

```bash
"Use the database-specialist and frontend-ui agents in parallel to implement the new audit trail feature"
```

## üìä Benefits

### 1. **Specialized Expertise**
Each agent has deep knowledge of their domain and follows best practices specific to your application.

### 2. **Automatic Routing**
Tasks are automatically routed to the right specialist without you having to think about it.

### 3. **Context Preservation**
Sub-agents work in separate contexts, keeping your main conversation clean and focused.

### 4. **Consistent Patterns**
Each agent follows established patterns and knows the critical files in your codebase.

## üîß Agent Capabilities

### Tool Access by Agent
- **Priority Integration**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep, WebFetch
- **Database**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep
- **Frontend UI**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep
- **Azure Deployment**: Bash, Read, Grep, Edit
- **Security Audit**: Read, Grep, WebSearch, Edit
- **Testing**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep
- **Performance**: Read, Grep, Bash, Edit

### Key Files Each Agent Knows
Each agent is pre-configured with knowledge of critical files:
- Priority agent knows `priorityService.ts`, `applicatorService.ts`
- Database agent knows model files, `database.ts`, `dbInit.ts`
- Frontend agent knows components, contexts, `Scanner.tsx`
- Azure agent knows deployment configs, VM details (20.217.84.100)
- Security agent knows auth middleware, security configs
- Testing agent knows test files and configurations
- Performance agent knows optimization targets and configs

## üìà Usage Examples

### Typical Workflows

1. **API Issue Investigation**
   ```
   "Priority API is returning 401 errors"
   ‚Üí priority-integration agent investigates auth flow
   ‚Üí Checks JWT tokens, API credentials, session management
   ```

2. **New Feature Development**
   ```
   "Add treatment approval workflow"
   ‚Üí database-specialist creates approval table
   ‚Üí frontend-ui creates approval components
   ‚Üí testing-specialist adds test coverage
   ```

3. **Production Deployment**
   ```
   "Deploy the latest changes and verify health"
   ‚Üí deployment-azure handles Azure VM deployment
   ‚Üí Checks container status and health endpoints
   ```

4. **Performance Investigation**
   ```
   "The app is loading slowly"
   ‚Üí performance-optimization agent analyzes bottlenecks
   ‚Üí Checks bundle size, API response times, database queries
   ```

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

### File Location
Agents are located in: `.claude/agents/`
- `priority-integration.md`
- `database-specialist.md`
- `frontend-ui.md`
- `deployment-azure.md`
- `security-audit.md`
- `testing-specialist.md`
- `performance-optimization.md`

### Customization
You can modify any agent by editing their markdown file:
- Update tool permissions in the YAML frontmatter
- Modify the description to change auto-trigger conditions
- Add domain-specific instructions in the system prompt

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Mention specific technologies or issues to trigger the right agent
2. **Use Keywords**: Include keywords like "Priority API", "Docker", "React", "database"
3. **Trust the System**: Let Claude Code choose the agent automatically for best results
4. **Multi-Agent Tasks**: Ask for parallel execution when tasks span multiple domains
5. **Override When Needed**: Explicitly request an agent if auto-selection isn't optimal
